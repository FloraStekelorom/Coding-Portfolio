# Coding-Portfolio

Specifications
Here are some user stories that you need to achieve for this project.
- I can access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.
- I can click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages.
- I can see thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built (if you haven't built any websites before, use placeholders.)
I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.

In other words, your web page needs to have a navigation bar, the links on the navigation bar will bring the viewer to each section. It needs to have social media buttons that go to your social media sites. It needs a portfolio section that showcases your work. And possibly an about section to describe yourself.
